# Common Support Answers

## Diagnostics Missing In Issue

You have filed an issue against the card, but failed to include the required
diagnostics and/or missed this warning in the new issue template:

```
<!-- =================================================================
***               PLEASE DO NOT IGNORE THIS TEMPLATE
***
*** This is the smallest amount of information needed to help you!
====================================================================== -->
```

Without the diagnostic data, it is substantially more time consuming to try to
"guess" the basic parameters necessary to help you. I _really_ want this card to
incrementally improve, and I think time is better spent working on reproducible
issues or new features, than guessing what versions/options you are using. The
new issue template asks for the minimum possible information to support you:

- **Diagnostics**: On the card, hold down the Default/Frigate menu button for a
  few seconds then paste the diagnostics into the issue between the backticks.
- **Description of the problem**: I need to understand the issue in sufficient
  detail.

This seems like a reasonably low bar for help, so if your issue gets closed for
not providing this information, please do not be offended. I want to help, just
need to prioritize my limited development time well. Feel free to re-open your
issue, providing the requested information.

## Misconceptions About open source

- The fixes aren't fast enough!
- The features aren't good enough!
- The quality control / testing is not sufficient!
- There are too many / too few releases!
- It breaks too frequently!
- This just isn't good enough!
- My tone is disrespectful!

This is the joy of open source. A sense of entitlement regarding when/how soon
fixes should be provided, or new features developed, is misunderstanding the
fundamental dynamics of open source. I am sorry you feel this way, but open
source software (including this card) is typically provided "as-is". Take it or
leave it. If you want things to go faster / differently, [please
contribute](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/1248). If
you don't want to contribute to the shared codebase, fork it and make your own.
Or pay for a (different) Enterprise grade solution to your problem. This is
certainly not that -- a card, developed in hobbiest-level time, with
hobbiest-level skills and ... at best ... hobbiest level support.

If you find yourself complaining, your expectations are incorrect! This is
undoubtedly frustrating (and I have often shared in this frustration), but it is
nonetheless just "the way open source is".

Thank you for understanding!
