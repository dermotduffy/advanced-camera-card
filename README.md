* Full [Picture Elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/) support.
* Theme friendly.

## Screenshots Below!

See more [screenshots](#screenshots) below.

## Installation

* [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is **highly** recommended to install the card -- it works for all Home Assistant variants. If you don't have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed, start there -- then come back to these instructions.

* Find the card in HACS:

```
Home Assistant > HACS > Frontend > "Explore & Add Integrations" > Frigate Card
```

* Click `Download this repository with HACS`.

#### Lovelace YAML users
If Lovelace is in YAML mode then there's an additional step required to load the resource into your browser. (This mode is not the default -- you would see`mode: yaml` under `lovelace:` in your `configuration.yaml` if this applies  to you),

* Add the following to `configuration.yaml` (note that `/hacsfiles/` is just an [optimized equivalent](https://hacs.xyz/docs/categories/plugins#custom-view-hacsfiles) of `/local/community/` that HACS natively supports):

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /hacsfiles/frigate-hass-card/frigate-hass-card.js
      type: module
```

* Restart Home Assistant.
* Add the new card to the Lovelace configuration!

<a name="manual-installation"></a>

### Advanced Users: Manual Installation

**Note:** This is very rarely needed unless you are developing the card. Please consider HACS (above)!

* Download the `frigate-hass-card.js` attachment of the desired [release](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/releases) to a location accessible by Home Assistant.
* Add the location as a Lovelace resource via the UI, or via [YAML configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/dashboards/#resources)) such as:

```yaml
lovelace:
  mode: yaml
  resources:
   - url: /local/frigate-hass-card.js
     type: module
```

## Configuration

At least 1 camera must be configured in the `cameras` section, but otherwise all configuration parameters are optional.

### Camera Options

The `cameras` block configures a list of cameras the card should support. The first listed camera is the default. Camera configuration is under:

```yaml
cameras:
  - [...camera 0 (default camera)...]
  - [...camera 1...]
  - [...camera 2...]
```

See the [fully expanded cameras configuration example](#config-expanded-cameras) for how these parameters are structured.

<a name="camera-frigate-configuration"></a>

#### Camera Frigate configuration

The `frigate` block configures options for a Frigate camera. This configuration is included as part of a camera entry in the `cameras` array.

```yaml
cameras:
 - frigate:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `camera_name` | Autodetected from `camera_entity` if that is specified. | :heavy_multiplication_x: | The Frigate camera name to use when communicating with the Frigate server, e.g. for viewing clips/snapshots or the JSMPEG live view.|
| `url` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | The URL of the frigate server. If set, this value will be (exclusively) used for a `Frigate UI` menu button. All other communication with Frigate goes via Home Assistant. |
| `label` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | A Frigate label / object filter used to filter events (clips & snapshots), e.g. `person`.|
| `zone` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | A Frigate zone used to filter events (clips & snapshots), e.g. `front_door`.|
| `client_id` | `frigate` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | The Frigate client id to use. If this Home Assistant server has multiple Frigate server backends configured, this selects which server should be used. It should be set to the MQTT client id configured for this server, see [Frigate Integration Multiple Instance Support](https://docs.frigate.video/integrations/home-assistant/#multiple-instance-support).|

#### Camera go2rtc configuration

The `go2rtc` block configures use of the `go2rtc` live provider. This configuration is included as part of a camera entry in the `cameras` array.

```yaml
cameras:
 - go2rtc:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `modes` | `[webrtc, mse, mp4, mjpeg]` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | An ordered array of `go2rtc` modes to use. Valid values are `webrtc`, `mse`, `mp4` or `mjpeg` values. |

#### Camera WebRTC Card configuration

The `webrtc_card` block configures only the entity/URL for this camera to be used with the WebRTC Card live provider. This configuration is included as part of a camera entry in the `cameras` array.

```yaml
cameras:
 - webrtc_card:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `entity` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | The RTSP entity to pass to the WebRTC Card for this camera. Specify this OR `url` (below). |
| `url` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | The RTSP url to pass to the WebRTC Card. Specify this OR `entity` (above). |

See [Using the WebRTC Card](#webrtc) below for more details on how to use the WebRTC Card live provider.

<a name="camera-dependencies-configuration"></a>

#### Camera Dependency Configuration

The `dependencies` block configures other cameras as dependents of this camera. Dependent cameras have their events fetched and merged with this camera. Configuration is under:

```yaml
cameras:
 - dependencies:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `cameras` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | An optional array of other camera identifiers (see [camera IDs](#camera-ids)). If specified the card will fetch events for this camera and *also* recursively events for the named cameras. All dependent cameras must themselves be a configured camera in the card. This can be useful to group events for cameras that are close together, to always have clips/snapshots show fully merged events across all cameras or to show events for the `birdseye` camera that otherwise would not have events itself.|
| `all_cameras` | `false` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Shortcut to specify all other cameras as dependent cameras.|

<a name="camera-triggers-configuration"></a>

#### Camera Trigger Configuration

The `triggers` block configures what triggers a camera. Triggering can be used to either reset to the default view / update the card, or active the camera in [scan mode](#scan-mode).

```yaml
cameras:
 - triggers:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `motion` | `false` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to not to trigger the camera by automatically detecting and using the motion `binary_sensor` for this camera. This autodetection only works for Frigate cameras, and only when the motion `binary_sensor` entity has been enabled in Home Assistant.|
| `occupancy` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to not to trigger the camera by automatically detecting and using the occupancy `binary_sensor` for this camera. This autodetection only works for Frigate cameras, and only when the occupancy `binary_sensor` entity has been enabled in Home Assistant.|
| `entities` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to not to trigger the camera when the state of any Home Assistant entity becomes active (i.e. state becomes `on` or `open`). This works for Frigate or non-Frigate cameras.|

<a name="camera-ids"></a>

#### Camera IDs: Refering to cameras in card configuration

Each camera configured in the card has a single identifier (`id`). For a given camera, this will be one of the camera {`id`, `camera_entity`, `webrtc_card.entity` or `frigate.camera_name`} parameters for that camera -- in that order of precedence. These ids may be used in conditions, dependencies or custom actions to refer to a given camera unambiguously. |

#### Example

See [the basic cameras configuration example](#basic-cameras-configuration) below.

### View Options

All configuration is under:

 ```yaml
view:
```

See the [fully expanded view configuration example](#config-expanded-view) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `default` | `live` | :white_check_mark: | The view to show in the card by default. The default camera is the first one listed. See [views](#views) below.|
| `camera_select` | `current` | :white_check_mark: | The view to show when a new camera is selected (e.g. in the camera menu). If `current` the view is unchanged when a new camera is selected. Other acceptable values may be seen at [views](#views) below.|
| `dark_mode` | `off` | :white_check_mark: | Whether or not to turn dark mode `on`, `off` or `auto` to automatically turn on if the card `timeout_seconds` has expired (i.e. card has been left unattended for that period of time) or if dark mode is enabled in the HA profile theme setting. Dark mode dims the brightness by `25%`.|
| `timeout_seconds` | `300` | :white_check_mark: | A numbers of seconds of inactivity after user interaction, after which the card will reset to the default configured view (i.e. 'screensaver' functionality). Inactivity is defined as lack of mouse/touch interaction with the Frigate card. If the default view occurs sooner (e.g. via `update_seconds` or manually) the timer will be stopped. `0` means disable this functionality. |
| `update_seconds` | `0` | :white_check_mark: | A number of seconds after which to automatically update/refresh the default view. See [card updates](#card-updates) below for behavior and usecases. If the default view occurs sooner (e.g. manually) the timer will start over. `0` disables this functionality.|
| `update_force` | `false` | :white_check_mark: | Whether automated card updates/refreshes should ignore user interaction. See [card updates](#card-updates) below for behavior and usecases.|
| `update_entities` | | :white_check_mark: | **YAML only**: A card-wide list of entities that should cause the view to reset to the default (if the entity only pertains to a particular camera use `triggers` for the selected camera instead, see [Trigger Configuration](#camera-triggers-configuration)). See [card updates](#card-updates) below for behavior and usecases.|
| `update_cycle_camera` | `false` | :white_check_mark: | When set to `true` the selected camera is cycled on each default view change. |
| `render_entities` | | :white_check_mark: | **YAML only**: A list of entity ids that should cause the card to re-render 'in-place'. The view/camera is not changed. `update_*` flags do not pertain/relate to the behavior of this flag. This should **very** rarely be needed, but could be useful if the card is both setting and changing HA state of the same object as could be the case for some complex `card_mod` scenarios ([example](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/343)). |
| `scan` | | :white_check_mark: | Configuration for [scan mode](#scan-mode). |
| `actions` | | :white_check_mark: | Actions to use for all views, individual actions may be overriden by view-specific actions. See [actions](#actions) below.|

<a name="scan-mode"></a>

#### View: Scan Mode configuration

All configuration is under:

```yaml
view:
  scan:
```

Scan mode allows the card to automatically "follow the action". In this mode the card will automatically select a camera in the `live` view when an entity changes to an active state (specifically `on` or `open`). The entities considered are defined by your camera configuration (see `triggers` parameters). An untrigger is defined as the state for all the configured entities returning to inactive (i.e. not `on` or `open`), with an optional number of seconds to wait prior to the untriggering (see `untrigger_seconds`).

When the camera untriggers, the view will either remain as-is (if `untrigger_reset` is `false`) and the card return to normal operation, or reset to the default view (if `untrigger_reset` is `true` -- the default).

Triggering is only allowed when there is no ongoing human interaction with the card -- interaction will automatically untrigger and further triggering will not occur until after the card has been unattended for `view.timeout_seconds`.

Scan mode tracks Home Assistant state *changes* -- when the card is first started, it takes an active change in state to trigger (i.e. an already occupied room will not trigger it, but a newly occupied room will).

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `enabled` | `false` | :white_check_mark: | Whether to enable scan mode. |
| `show_trigger_status` | `true` | :white_check_mark: | Whether or not the card should show a visual indication that it is triggered (a pulsing border around the card edge). |
| `untrigger_reset` | `true` | :white_check_mark: | Whether or not to reset the view to the default after untriggering. |
| `untrigger_seconds` | `0` | :white_check_mark: | The number of seconds to wait after all entities are inactive before untriggering. |

### Menu Options

All configuration is under:

 ```yaml
menu:
```

See the [fully expanded menu configuration example](#config-expanded-menu) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `style` | `hidden` | :white_check_mark: | The menu style to show by default, one of `none`, `hidden`, `hover`, `hover-card`, `overlay`, or `outside`. See [menu styles](#menu-styles) below.|
| `position` | `top` | :white_check_mark: | Whether to show the menu on the `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` side of the card. Note that for the `outside` style only the `top` and `bottom` positions have an effect.|
| `alignment` | `left` | :white_check_mark: | Whether to align the menu buttons to the `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` of the menu. Some selections may have no effect depending on the value of `position` (e.g. it doesn't make sense to `left` align icons on a menu with `position` to the `left`).|
| `button_size` | 40 | :white_check_mark: | The size of the menu buttons in pixels. Must be >= `20`.|
| `buttons` | | :white_check_mark: | Whether to show or hide built-in buttons. See below. |

#### Menu Options: Buttons

All configuration is under:

```yaml
menu:
  buttons:
    [button]:
```

##### Buttons

| Option | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `frigate` | :white_check_mark: | The `Frigate` menu button: brings the user to the default configured view (`view.default`), or collapses/expands the menu if the `menu.style` is `hidden` . |
| `cameras` | :white_check_mark: | The camera selection submenu. Will only appear if multiple cameras are configured. |
| `live` | :white_check_mark: | The `live` view menu button: brings the user to the `live` view. See [views](#views) below.|
| `clips` | :white_check_mark: | The `clips` view menu button: brings the user to the `clips` view on tap and the most-recent `clip` view on hold. See [views](#views) below. This button will never be shown if the `frigate.camera_name` for the selected camera is not auto-detected/specified (e.g. non-Frigate cameras), or if the `frigate.camera_name` is `birdseye`.|
| `snapshots` | :white_check_mark: | The `snapshots` view menu button: brings the user to the `clips` view on tap and the most-recent `snapshot` view on hold. See [views](#views) below. This button will never be shown if the `frigate.camera_name` for the selected camera is not auto-detected/specified (e.g. non-Frigate cameras), or if the `frigate.camera_name` is `birdseye`.|
| `recordings` | :white_check_mark: | The `recordings` view menu button: brings the user to the `recordings` view on tap and the most-recent `recording` view on hold. See [views](#views) below. This button will never be shown if the `frigate.camera_name` for the selected camera is not auto-detected/specified (e.g. non-Frigate cameras), or if the `frigate.camera_name` is `birdseye`.|
| `image` | :white_check_mark: | The `image` view menu button: brings the user to the static `image` view. See [views](#views) below.|
| `download` | :white_check_mark: | The `download` menu button: allow direct download of the media being displayed.|
| `camera_ui` | :white_check_mark: | The `camera_ui` menu button: brings the user to a context-appropriate page on the UI of their camera engine (e.g. the Frigate camera homepage). Will only appear if the camera engine supports a camera UI (e.g. if `frigate.url` option is set for `frigate` engine users).|
| `fullscreen` | :white_check_mark: | The `fullscreen` menu button: expand the card to consume the fullscreen. |
| `timeline` | :white_check_mark: | The `timeline` menu button: show the event timeline. |
| `media_player` | :white_check_mark: | The `media_player` menu button: sends the visible media to a remote media player. Supports Frigate clips, snapshots and live camera (only for cameras that specify a `camera_entity` and only using the default HA stream (equivalent to the `ha` live provider). `jsmpeg` or `webrtc-card` are not supported, although live can still be played as long as `camera_entity` is specified. In the player list, a `tap` will send the media to the player, a `hold` will stop the media on the player. |

##### Configuration on each button

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `enabled` | `true` for all buttons except `image` | :white_check_mark: | Whether or not to show the button. |
| `priority` | `50` | :white_check_mark: | The button priority. Higher priority buttons are ordered closer to the start of the menu alignment (i.e. a button with priority `70` will order further to the left than a button with priority `60`, when the menu alignment is `left`). Minimum `0`, maximum `100`.|
| `icon` | | :white_check_mark: | An icon to overriding the default for that button, e.g. `mdi:camera-front`. |
| `alignment` | `matching` | :white_check_mark: | Whether this button should have an alignment that is `matching` the menu alignment or `opposing` the menu. Can be used to create two separate groups of buttons on the menu. `priority` orders buttons within a given `alignment`. |

### Live Options

All configuration is under:

 ```yaml
live:
```

See the [fully expanded live configuration example](#config-expanded-live) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `preload` | `false` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether or not to preload the live view. Preloading causes the live view to render in the background regardless of what view is actually shown, so it's instantly available when requested. This consumes additional network/CPU resources continually. |
| `auto_play` | `all` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to automatically play live camera feeds. `never` will never automatically play, `selected` will automatically play when a camera is selected in the carousel, `visible` will automatically play when the browser/tab becomes visible or `all` on any opportunity to automatically play (i.e. either case). Some live providers (e.g. `webrtc-card`, `jsmpeg`) do not support the prevention of automatic play on initial load, but should still respect the value of this flag on play-after-pause.|
| `auto_pause` | `never` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to automatically pause live camera feeds. `never` will never automatically pause, `unselected` will automatically pause when a camera is unselected in the carousel, `hidden` will automatically pause when the browser/tab becomes hidden or `all` on any opportunity to automatically pause (i.e. either case). **Caution**: Some live providers (e.g. `jsmpeg`) may not offer human-accessible means to resume play if it is paused, unless the `auto_play` option (above) is used.|
| `auto_mute` | `all` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to automatically mute live camera feeds. `never` will never automatically mute, `unselected` will automatically mute when a camera is unselected in the carousel, `hidden` will automatically mute when the browser/tab becomes hidden or `all` on any opportunity to automatically mute (i.e. either case). Note that if `auto_play` is enabled, the stream may mute itself automatically in order to honor the `auto_play` setting, as some browsers will not auto play media that is unmuted -- that is to say, where necessary, the `auto_play` parameter will take priority over the `auto_mute` parameter.|
| `auto_unmute` | `never` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether to automatically unmute live camera feeds. `never` will never automatically unmute, `selected` will automatically unmute when a camera is unselected in the carousel, `visible` will automatically unmute when the browser/tab becomes visible or `all` on any opportunity to automatically unmute (i.e. either case).|
| `lazy_load` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether or not to lazily load cameras in the camera carousel. Setting this will `false` will cause all cameras to load simultaneously when the `live` carousel is opened (or cause all cameras to load continually if both `lazy_load` and `preload` are `true`). This will result in a smoother carousel experience at a cost of (potentially) a substantial amount of continually streamed data. |
| `lazy_unload` | `never` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | When to lazily **un**load lazyily-loaded cameras. `never` will never lazily-unload, `unselected` will lazy-unload a camera when it is unselected in the carousel, `hidden` will lazy-unload all cameras when the browser/tab becomes hidden or `all` on any opportunity to lazily unload (i.e. either case). This will cause a reloading delay on revisiting that camera in the carousel but will save the streaming network resources that are otherwise consumed. This option has no effect if `lazy_load` is false. Some live providers (e.g. `webrtc-card`) implement their own lazy unloading independently which may occur regardless of the value of this setting.|
| `draggable` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether or not the live carousel can be dragged left or right, via touch/swipe and mouse dragging. |
| `transition_effect` | `slide` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Effect to apply as a transition between live cameras. Accepted values: `slide` or `none`. |
| `show_image_during_load` | `true` | :white_check_mark: | If `true`, during the initial stream load, the `image` live provider will be shown instead of the loading video stream. This still image will auto-refresh and is replaced with the live stream once loaded. |
| `actions` | | :white_check_mark: | Actions to use for the `live` view. See [actions](#actions) below.|
| `controls` | | :white_check_mark: | Configuration for the `live` view controls. See below. |
| `jsmpeg` | | :white_check_mark: | Configuration for the `jsmpeg` live provider. See below.|
| `webrtc_card` | | :white_check_mark: | Configuration for the `webrtc-card` live provider. See below.|
| `layout` | | :white_check_mark: | See [media layout](#media-layout) below.|

#### Live Provider: Image Configuration

All configuration is under:

```yaml
live:
  image:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |

| - | - | - | - |
| `options` | | :white_check_mark: | **Advanced users only**: Control the underlying [JSMPEG library options](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg#usage). Supports setting these JSMPEG options `{audio, video, pauseWhenHidden, disableGl, disableWebAssembly, preserveDrawingBuffer, progressive, throttled, chunkSize, maxAudioLag, videoBufferSize, audioBufferSize}`. This is not necessary for the vast majority of users: only set these flags if you know what you're doing, as you may entirely break video rendering in the card.|

<a name="media-gallery-options"></a>

### Media Gallery Options

The `media_gallery` is used for providing an overview of all `clips`, `snapshots` and `recordings` in a thumbnail gallery.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
media_gallery:
```

See the [fully expanded media gallery configuration example](#config-expanded-media-gallery) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `controls` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Configuration for the Media viewer controls. See below. |
| `actions` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Actions to use for all views that use the `media_gallery` (e.g. `clips`, `snapshots`, `recordings`). See [actions](#actions) below.|

    thumbnails:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |

### Image Options

All configuration is under:

```yaml
image:
```

See the [fully expanded image configuration example](#config-expanded-image) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `mode` | `url` | :white_check_mark: | Mode of the the `image` [view](#views). Value must be one of `url` (to fetch an arbitrary image URL), `camera` (to show a still of the currently selected camera using either `camera_entity` or `webrtc_card.entity` in that order of precedence), or `screensaver` (to show an [embedded stock Frigate card logo](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/blob/release-4.0.0/src/images/frigate-bird-in-sky.jpg)). In either `url` or `camera` mode, the `screensaver` content is used as a fallback if a URL is not specified or cannot be derived. |
| `url` | | :white_check_mark: |  A static image URL to be used when the `mode` is set to `url` or when a temporary image is required (e.g. may appear momentarily prior to load of a camera snapshot in the `camera` mode). Note that a `_t=[timestsamp]` query parameter will be automatically added to all URLs such that the image will not be cached by the browser.|
| `refresh_seconds` | 0 | :white_check_mark: | The image will be refreshed at least every `refresh_seconds` (it may refresh more frequently, e.g. whenever Home Assistant updates its camera security token). `0` implies no refreshing. |
| `actions` | | :white_check_mark: | Actions to use for the `image` view. See [actions](#actions) below.|

**Note**: When `mode` is set to `camera` this is effectively providing the same image as the `image` live provider would show in the live camera carousel.

### Timeline Options

The `timeline` is used to show the timing sequence of events and recordings across cameras. You can interact with the timeline in a number of ways:

* Clicking on an event will take you to the media viewer for that event.
* Clicking on the "background", or a camera title, will take you to the recordings for that camera (seeking to the clicked time).
* Clicking on the time axis will take you to recordings for all cameras (seeking to the clicked time).

All configuration is under:

```yaml
timeline:
```

See the [fully expanded timeline configuration example](#config-expanded-timeline) for how these parameters are structured.

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |

<a name="dimensions"></a>

### Dimensions Options

These options control the aspect-ratio of the entire card to make placement in
Home Assistant dashboards more stable. Aspect ratio configuration applies once
to the entire card (including the menu, thumbnails, etc), not just to displayed
media.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
dimensions:
```

See the [fully expanded dimensions configuration example](#config-expanded-dimensions) for how these parameters are structured.


| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `aspect_ratio_mode` | `dynamic` | :white_check_mark: | The aspect ratio mode to use. Acceptable values: `dynamic`, `static`, `unconstrained`. See [aspect ratios](#aspect-ratios) below.|
| `aspect_ratio` | `16:9` | :white_check_mark: | The aspect ratio  to use. Acceptable values: `<W>:<H>` or `<W>/<H>`. See [aspect ratios](#aspect-ratios) below.|

#### `dimensions.aspect_ratio_mode`:

| Option           | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dynamic` | The aspect-ratio of the card will match the aspect-ratio of the last loaded media. |
| `static` | A fixed aspect-ratio (as defined by `dimensions.aspect_ratio`) will be applied to all views. |
| `unconstrained` | No aspect ratio is enforced in any view, the card will expand with the content (may be especially useful for a panel-mode dashboard). |

#### `dimensions.aspect_ratio`:

* `16 / 9` or `16:9`: Default widescreen ratio.
* `4 / 3` or `4:3`: Default fullscreen ratio.
* `<W>/<H>` or `<W>:<H>`: Any arbitrary aspect-ratio.

<a name="aspect-ratios"></a>

#### Aspect Ratio

The card can show live cameras, stored events (clip or snapshot) and an event
gallery (clips or snapshots). Of these [views](#views), the gallery views have
no intrinsic aspect-ratio, whereas the other views have the aspect-ratio of the
media.

The card aspect ratio can be changed with the `dimensions.aspect_ratio_mode` and
`dimensions.aspect_ratio` options described above.

If no aspect ratio is specified or available, but one is needed then `16:9` will
be used by default.

<a name="performance-options"></a>

### Performance Options

These options control the card performance settings to enable the card to run
(more) smoothly on lower end devices.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
performance:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `profile` | `high` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Whether the card is configured in full `high` performance mode, or `low` performance defaults for lower end devices. See [low performance profile](#performance-profile-low) below.|

#### Feature Options

Controls card-wide central functionality that may impact performance but which is not configurable elsewhere.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
performance:
  features:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `animated_progress_indicator` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | Will show the animated progress indicator 'spinner' when `true` or a simple loading icon when `false`.|
| `media_chunk_size` | `50` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | How many media items to fetch and render at a time (e.g. thumbnails under a live view, or number of snapshots to load in the media viewer). This may only make partial sense in some contexts (e.g. the 'infinite gallery' is still infinite, just loads thumbnails this many items at a time) or not at all (e.g. the timeline will show the number of events dictated by the time span the user navigates to).|

#### Style Options

Style performance options request the card minimize certain expensive CSS
stylings. This does not necessarily disable these stylings _entirely_ since that
may break the basic expected visuals of the card (e.g. menu icons need curves),
but rather avoids use of them in high item-count situations (e.g. avoiding
shadows on timeline items, or curves in the media gallery items).

All configuration is under:

```yaml
performance:
  style:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `border_radius` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | If `false` minimizes the usage of rounded corners.|
| `box_shadow` | `true` | :heavy_multiplication_x: | If `false` minimizes the usage of shadows.|

<a name="performance-profile-low"></a>

#### Performance Profile `low`

In the `low` performance profile, the card attempts to lower the CPU and network
consumption of the card by setting default option values when they have not been explicitly set by the user.

Principles used in the selection of options set by `low` profile mode:

* Get 'out of the box' performance similar to the basic "Home Assistant Picture Glance" card.
* Only change behavior that the user can case-by-case 'reset' by explicitly setting an option elsewhere.
* Do not break the visual aesthetic of the card.

**Note:**: Since the performance profile changes the _default_ value of options,
setting the `low` profile on a pre-existing card could have no effect if there are
considerable options already set by the user.

Please see <a href="src/performance.ts">the source code</a> for an exhaustive list of options set by `low` profile mode. Summary:

* The default live provider (`auto`) will resolve to the `image` live provider for cameras with a `camera_entity` specified. It will have a refresh period of 10 seconds (same as the stock Home Assistant Picture Glance card).
* No event thumbnails fetched.
* No recordings shown.
* No automated actions (e.g. mute, play, pause) except playing in live view.
* Always lazily unload anything that can be unloaded.
* Carousels are not draggable and have no 'slide' effects.
* Live image is not shown during stream loads.
* No title popups.
* Menu rendered outside the main body of the card, with reduced menu buttons.
* All optional performace features and performance styles (described above) disabled.

<a name="overrides"></a>

### Overrides Options

All configuration is a list under:

```yaml
overrides:
```

See the [fully expanded overrides configuration example](#config-expanded-overrides) for how these parameters are structured.

Various parts of this configuration may conditionally (see [Frigate Card
Conditions](#frigate-card-conditions)) be overridden, for example to use custom
WebRTC parameters for a particular camera or to hide the menu in fullscreen mode.

Not all configuration parameters are overriddable (only those with check marks
in this documentation) -- some because it doesn't make sense for that parameter
to vary, and many because of the extra complexity of supporting overriding given
the lack of compelling usecases ([please request new overridable parameters
here!](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/new/choose)).

Each entry under the top-level `overrides` configuration block should be a list
item, that has both of the following parameters set:

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `conditions` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: | A set of conditions that must evaluate to `true` in order for the overrides to be applied. See [Frigate Card Conditions](#frigate-card-conditions). |
| `overrides` | | :heavy_multiplication_x: |Configuration overrides to be applied. Any configuration parameter described in this documentation as 'Overridable' is supported. |

<a name="media-layout"></a>

### Media Layout

The `live`, `media_viewer` and `image` sections all support `layout` option which is used to control the fit and position of the media _within_ the card dimensions (in order to control the card dimensions themselves see [the dimensions parameter](#dimensions) ).

As the default card behavior is for the card to always expand to fit the media, these options only make sense if `dimensions.aspect_ratio_mode` is set to `static`.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
live:
  layout:
image:
  layout:
media_viewer:
  layout:
```

| Option | Default | Overridable | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `fit` | `contain` | :white_check_mark: | If `contain`, the media is contained within the card and letterboxed if necessary. If `cover`, the media is expanded proportionally (i.e. maintaining the media aspect ratio) until the card is fully covered. If `fill`, the media is stretched to fill the card (i.e. ignoring the media aspect ratio). See [CSS object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) for technical details and a visualization. |
| `position` | | :white_check_mark: | A dictionary that contains an `x` and `y` percentage (`0` - `100`) to control the position of the media when the fit is `cover`. This can be effectively used to "pan" the media around. At any given time, only one of `x` and `y` will have an effect, depending on whether media width is larger than the card width (in which case `x` controls the position) or the media height is larger than the card height (in which case `y` controls the position). A value of `0` means maximally to the left or top of the media, a value of `100` means maximally to the right or bottom of the media. See [CSS object-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) for technical details and a visualization. |

If multiple cameras are configured in the card, use [overrides](#overrides) to configure different values per camera.

See [media layout examples](#media-layout-examples).

### Using AlexxIT's WebRTC Card

WebRTC Card support blends the use of the ultra-realtime [WebRTC card live
view](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC) with convenient access to Frigate
events/snapshots/UI. A perfect combination!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/release-4.0.0/images/webrtc.png" alt="Live viewing" width="400px">

**Note**: AlexxIT's WebRTC Integration/Card must be installed and configured separately (see [details](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC)) before it can be used with this card.

#### Specifying The WebRTC Card Camera

The WebRTC Card live provider does **not** support use of Frigate-provided
camera entities, as it requires an RTSP stream which Frigate does not currently
provide. There are two ways to specify the WebRTC Card source camera:

* Manual setup of separate RTSP camera entities in Home Assistant ([see
  example](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic/#live-stream)).
  These entities will then be available for selection in the GUI card editor for
  the camera, or can be manually specified with a `webrtc_card.entity` option under
  that particular cameras configuration:

```yaml
cameras:
 - webrtc_card:
     entity: 'camera.front_door_rstp`
```

* OR manually entering the WebRTC Card camera URL parameter in the GUI card
  editor, or configuring the `url` parameter as part of a manual Frigate card
  configuration, as illustrated in the following example:

```yaml
cameras:
 - webrtc_card:
     url: 'rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CAMERA:554/RTSP_PATH'
```

Other WebRTC Card options may be specified under the `live` section, like so:

```yaml
live:
  webrtc_card:
    ui: true
```

See [the WebRTC Card live configuration](#webrtc-live-configuration) above, and the
[external WebRTC Card configuration
documentation](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC#configuration) for full
configuration options that can be used here.

<a name="frigate-card-conditions"></a>

## Frigate Card Conditions

Conditions are used to apply certain configuration depending on runtime evaluations. Conditions may be used in `elements` configuration (as part of a `custom:frigate-card-conditional` element) or the `overrides` configuration (see below for both).

All variables listed are under a `conditions:` section.

| Condition | Description |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `view` | A list of [views](#views) in which this condition is satified (e.g. `clips`) |
| `camera` | A list of camera ids in which this condition is satisfied. See [camera IDs](#camera-ids).|
| `fullscreen` | If `true` the condition is satisfied if the card is in fullscreen mode. If `false` the condition is satisfied if the card is **NOT** in fullscreen mode.|
| `state` | A list of state conditions to compare with Home Assistant state. See below. |
| `media_loaded` | If `true` the condition is satisfied if there is media load**ED** (not load**ING**) in the card (e.g. a clip, snapshot or live view). This may be used to hide controls during media loading or when a message (not media) is being displayed. Note that if `true` this condition will never be satisfied for views that do not themselves load media directly (e.g. gallery).|
| `media_query` | Any valid [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) string. Media queries must start and end with parentheses. This may be used to alter card configuration based on device/media properties (e.g. viewport width, orientation). Please note that `width` and `height` refer to the entire viewport not just the card. See the [media query example](#media-query-example).|

See the [example below](#frigate-card-conditional-example) for a real-world example of how these conditions can be used.

### State Conditions

```yaml
- conditions:
    state:
      - [entries]
```

The Frigate Card Condition can compare HA state against fixed string values. This is the same as the Home Assistant [Conditional Element](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/picture-elements/#conditional-element) condition, but can be used outside of a Picture Element context (e.g. card configuration overrides).

If multiple entries are provided, the results are `AND`ed.

| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| `entity` | The entity ID to check the state for |
| `state` | Condition will be met if state is equal to this optional string. |
| `state_not` | Condition will be met if state is unequal to this optional string. |

See the [Menu override example below](#frigate-card-menu-override-example) for an illustration.

## Picture Elements / Menu Customizations

This card supports the [Picture Elements configuration
syntax](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/) to seamlessly
allow the user to add custom elements to the card, which may be configured to
perform a variety of actions on interaction (see [actions](#actions) below). The configuration is fairly versatile and can be simple, or very complex depending on the desires of the user.

All configuration is under:

```yaml
elements:
```

See the [fully expanded elements configuration example](#config-expanded-elements) for how these parameters are structured.

**Note**: The Frigate Card allows either a single action (as in stock Home
Assistant) or list of actions to be defined for each class of user interaction
(e.g. `tap`, `double_tap`, `hold`, etc). See [an example of multiple actions](#example-multiple-actions).

### Special Elements

This card supports all [Picture
Elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/#icon-element)
using compatible syntax. The card also supports a handful of custom special
elements to add special Frigate card functionality.

| Element name | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `custom:frigate-card-menu-icon` | Add an arbitrary icon to the Frigate Card menu. Configuration is ~identical to that of the [Picture Elements Icon](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/#icon-element) except with a type name of `custom:frigate-card-menu-icon`.|
| `custom:frigate-card-menu-state-icon` | Add a state icon to the Frigate Card menu that represents the state of a Home Assistant entity. Configuration is ~identical to that of the [Picture Elements State Icon](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/#state-icon) except with a type name of `custom:frigate-card-menu-state-icon`.|
| `custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu` | Add a configurable submenu dropdown. See [configuration below](#frigate-card-menu-submenu).|
| `custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu-select` | Add a submenu based on a `select` or `input_select`. See [configuration below](#frigate-card-submenu-select).|
| `custom:frigate-card-conditional` | Restrict a set of elements to only render when the card is showing particular a particular [view](#views). See [configuration below](#frigate-card-conditional).|
| `custom:frigate-card-ptz` | Add a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) controller overlay. See [configuration below](#frigate-card-ptz).|


**Note**: ℹ️ Manual positioning of custom menu icons or submenus via the `style`
parameter is not supported as the menu buttons displayed are context sensitive
so manual positioning by the user is not feasible.

| `type` | Must be `custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu`. |
| `items` | A list of menu items, as described below. |

<a name="frigate-card-submenu-items"></a>

##### Submenu Items

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `title` | | An optional title to display. |
| `icon` | | An optional item icon to display, e.g. `mdi:car` |
| `entity` | | An optional Home Assistant entity from which title, icon and style can be automatically computed. |

### Navigating From A Snapshot To A Clip

Clicking on a snapshot will take the user to a clip that was taken at the ~same
time as the snapshot (if any).

<a name="actions"></a>

## Actions

### Introduction to Actions

Actions are pre-configured activities that can be triggered in response to a
variety of circumstances (e.g. tapping on a menu icon, double tapping on a
[picture element](#frigate-card-elements) or holding the mouse/tap down on a
particular [view](#views)).

### Configuring Actions

The format for actions is the standard Home Assistant [action
format](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/actions/#tap-action), with the
exception of differences called out below.

### Differences in actions between Frigate Card and Home Assistant

Both the Home Assistant frontend and the Frigate card cooperate to provide
action functionality. In general, the Frigate Card functionality is a superset
of that offered by stock Home Assistant.

Stock action functionality is used for Stock [Home Assistant picture
elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/). Extended
Frigate card behavior covers all other interactions on the Frigate card (e.g.
menu icon elements, submenus and actions on the card or views).

#### Custom action types: `start_tap` and `end_tap`

The card has partial support for two special action types `start_tap` and
`end_tap` which occur when a tap is started (e.g. mouse is pressed down /
touch begins), and ended (e.g. mouse released / touch ends) respectively. This
might be useful for PTZ cameras cameras to start/stop movement on touch. Network
latency may introduce unavoidable imprecision between `end_tap` and action
actually occurring.

#### Multiple actions

Extended Frigate card behavior supports a list of actions which will be handled,
in addition to using a singular action. See [an example of multiple
actions](#example-multiple-actions) below.

### Card & View Actions

Actions may be attached to the card itself, to trigger action when the card
experiences a `tap`, `double_tap`, `hold`, `start_tap` or `end_tap` event. These
actions can be specified both for the overall card and for individual groups of
view.

| Configuration path | Views to which it refers |
| - | - |
| `view.actions` | All (may be overriden by the below) |
| `media_gallery.actions` | `clips`, `snapshots`, `recordings` |
| `media_viewer.actions` | `clip`, `snapshot`, `recording` |
| `live.actions` | `live` |
| `image.actions` | `image` |

If an action is configured for both the whole card (`view.actions`) and a more
specific view (e.g. `live.actions`) then the actions are merged, with the more
specific overriding the less specific (see example below).

**Note:** The card itself relies on user interactions to function (e.g. `tap` on
the menu should activate that button, `tap` on a gallery thumbnail should open
that piece of media, etc). Efforts are taken to de-duplicate interactions (e.g.
card-wide actions will not be activated through interaction with menu buttons,
next/previous controls, thumbnails, etc), but in some cases this is not possible
(e.g. embedded WebRTC card controls) -- in these cases duplicate actions may
occur with certain configurations (e.g. `tap`).

**Note:** Card-wide actions are not supported on the timeline view, nor when a
info/error message is being displayed.

## Menu Styles

This card supports several menu styles.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Basic cameras configuration</summary>

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.sitting_room
  - camera_entity: camera.front_door
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Expand: Different providers for a single camera</summary>

Cameras can be repeated with different providers (note the required use of `id`
to provide a separate unambiguous way of referring to that camera, since the
`camera_entity` is shared between the two cameras).

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.front_door
    live_provider: jsmpeg
    title: Front Door (JSMPEG)
  - camera_entity: camera.front_door
    live_provider: webrtc-card
    title: Front Door (WebRTC)
    webrtc_card:
      entity: camera.front_door_rtsp
    id: front-door-webrtc
```
</details>

### WebRTC Card Provider

```
</details>

</details>

### Static Aspect Ratios

You can set a static aspect ratio.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Static 4:3 aspect ratios</summary>

```yaml
[...]
dimensions:
  aspect_ratio_mode: static
  aspect_ratio: '4:3'
```
</details>

### Adding Menu Icons

You can add custom icons to the menu with arbitrary actions.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Custom menu icon</summary>

This example adds an icon that navigates the browser to the releases page for this
card:

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-icon
    icon: mdi:book
    tap_action:
      action: url
      url_path: https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/releases
```
</details>

### Adding Menu State Icons

You can add custom state icons to the menu to show the state of an entity and complete arbitrary actions.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Custom menu state icon</summary>

This example adds an icon that represents the state of the
`light.office_main_lights` entity, that toggles the light on double click.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-state-icon
    entity: light.office_main_lights
    tap_action:
      action: toggle
```
</details>

### Adding State Badges

You can add a state badge to the card showing arbitrary entity states.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: State badge</summary>

This example adds a state badge showing the temperature and hides the label text:

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: state-badge
    entity: sensor.kitchen_temperature
    style:
      right: '-20px'
      top: 100px
      color: rgba(0,0,0,0)
      opacity: 0.5
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/release-4.0.0/images/picture_elements_temperature.png" alt="Picture elements temperature example" width="400px">
</details>

### Adding State Badges

You can have icons conditionally added to the menu based on entity state.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Conditional menu icons</summary>

This example only adds the light entity to the menu if a light is on.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: light.kitchen
        state: 'on'
    elements:
      - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-state-icon
        entity: light.kitchen
        tap_action:
          action: toggle
```
</details>

<a name="frigate-card-conditional-example"></a>

### Restricting Icons To Certain Views

You can restrict icons to only show for certain [views](#views) using a
`custom:frigate-card-conditional` element

<details>
  <summary>Expand: View-based conditions</summary>

This example shows a car icon that calls a service but only in the `live` view.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-conditional
    conditions:
      view:
        - live
    elements:
      - type: icon
        icon: mdi:car
        style:
          background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)
          border-radius: 5px
          right: 25px
          bottom: 50px
        tap_action:
          action: call-service
          service: amcrest.ptz_control
          service_data:
            entity_id: camera.kitchen
            movement: up
```
</details>

<a name="frigate-card-action"></a>

### Triggering Card Actions

You can control the card itself with the `custom:frigate-card-action` action.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Custom fullscreen button</summary>

This example shows an icon that toggles the card fullscreen mode.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: icon
    icon: mdi:fullscreen
    style:
      left: 40px
      top: 40px
    tap_action:
      action: custom:frigate-card-action
      frigate_card_action: fullscreen
```
</details>

### Adding Card-wide Actions

You can add actions to the card to be trigger on `tap`, `double_tap`, `hold`, `start_tap` or `end_tap`. See [actions](#actions) above.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Adding a card-wide action</summary>

In this example double clicking the card in any view will cause the card to go
into fullscreen mode, **except** when the view is `live` in which case the
office lights are toggled.

```yaml
[...]
view:
  actions:
    double_tap_action:
      action: custom:frigate-card-action
      frigate_card_action: fullscreen
live:
  actions:
    entity: light.office_main_lights
    double_tap_action:
      action: toggle
```
</details>

<a name="configuring-a-submenu-example"></a>

### Configuring a submenu

You can add submenus to the menu -- buttons that when pressed reveal a dropdown submenu of configurable options.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Adding a submenu</summary>

This example shows a submenu that illustrates a variety of actions.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu
    icon: mdi:menu
    items:
      - title: Lights
        icon: mdi:lightbulb
        entity: light.office_main_lights
        tap_action:
          action: toggle
      - title: Google
        icon: mdi:google
        tap_action:
          action: url
          url_path: https://www.google.com
      - title: Fullscreen
        icon: mdi:fullscreen
        tap_action:
          action: custom:frigate-card-action
          frigate_card_action: fullscreen
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Custom submenus per camera</summary>

This example shows submenus conditional on the camera selected.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-conditional
    conditions:
      camera:
        - camera.front_door
    elements:
      - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu
        icon: mdi:door
        items:
          - title: Front Door Lights
            icon: mdi:lightbulb
            entity: light.front_door_lights
            tap_action:
              action: toggle
  - type: custom:frigate-card-conditional
    conditions:
      camera:
        - camera.living_room
    elements:
      - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu
        icon: mdi:sofa
        items:
          - title: Living Room Lights
            icon: mdi:lightbulb
            entity: light.living_room_lights
            tap_action:
              action: toggle
          - title: Living Room Lamp
            icon: mdi:lightbulb
            entity: light.living_room_lamp
            tap_action:
              action: toggle
```

</details>

<a name="configuring-a-select-submenu-example"></a>

### Configuring a `select` submenu

You can easily add a submenu to the menu based on a `select` or `input_select` entity.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Adding a select submenu</summary>

This example imagines the user has an `input_select` entity configured in their Home Assistant configuration like so:

```yaml
input_select:
  kitchen_scene:
    name: Kitchen Scene Select
    options:
      - scene.kitchen_cooking_scene
      - scene.kitchen_tv_scene
    icon: mdi:lightbulb
```

The following will convert this entity into a submenu:

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu-select
    entity: input_select.kitchen_scene
```

To override 1 or more individual options (e.g. to set custom icons and titles)

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-submenu-select
    icon: mdi:lamps
    entity: input_select.kitchen_scene
    options:
      scene.kitchen_cooking_scene:
        icon: mdi:chef-hat
        title: Cooking time!
      scene.kitchen_tv_scene:
        icon: mdi:television
        title: TV!
```
</details>

### Overriding card behavior

You can override card configuration when certain [conditions](#frigate-card-conditions) are met.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Hiding the menu in fullscreen mode</summary>

This example disables the menu unless the card is in fullscreen mode, and uses a
card-wide action to enable fullscreen mode on `double_tap`:

```yaml
view:
  actions:
    double_tap_action:
      action: custom:frigate-card-action
      frigate_card_action: fullscreen
overrides:
  - conditions:
      fullscreen: true
    overrides:
      menu:
        style: none
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Enable WebRTC Card UI only for a selected camera</summary>

This example enables WebRTC Card UI mode for a particular camera.

```yaml
cameras:
 - camera_entity: camera.office
   live_provider: webrtc-card
 - camera_entity: camera.a-different-camera
[...]
overrides:
  - conditions:
      camera:
        - camera.office
    overrides:
      live:
        webrtc_card:
          ui: true
```

</details>

<a name="frigate-card-menu-override-example"></a>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Change the menu position based on HA state</summary>

```yaml
overrides:
  - conditions:
      state:
        - entity: light.office_lights
          state: 'on'
    overrides:
      menu:
        position: bottom
```
</details>


<a name="frigate-card-menu-override-example"></a>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Change the default view based on HA state</summary>

This example changes the default card view from `live` to `image` depending on
the value of the `binary_sensor.alarm_armed` sensor. Note that the override
alone will only change the _default_ when the card next is requested to change
to the default view. By also including the `update_entities` parameter, we ask
the card to trigger a card update based on that entity -- which causes it to use
the new overriden default immediately. Alternatives to trigger the card to
change view but without `update_entities` would just be having an
`update_seconds` parameter which reloads the default view that many seconds
after user interaction stops or through the use of the `triggers` option for a
given camera (see [Trigger Configuration](#camera-triggers-configuration)).

```yaml
view:
  default: live
  update_entities:
    - binary_sensor.alarm_armed
overrides:
  - conditions:
      state:
        - entity: binary_sensor.alarm_armed
          state: 'off'
    overrides:
      view:
        default: image
```
</details>

### Refreshing a static image

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Auto-refreshing a static image</summary>

This example fetches a static image every 10 seconds (in this case the latest image saved on the Frigate server for a given camera).

```yaml
[...]
view:
  default: image
image:
  src: https://my-friage-server/api/living_room/latest.jpg
  refresh_seconds: 10
```
</details>

<a name="example-multiple-actions"></a>

### Defining multiple actions for Elements

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Changing camera and view simultaneously</summary>

This example shows how to configure multiple actions for a single Frigate card user interaction, in this case both selecting a different camera and changing the view on `tap`. Note that multiple actions are not supported on stock Picture Elements, see [actions](#actions) for more information.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-menu-icon
    icon: mdi:chair-rolling
    tap_action:
      - action: custom:frigate-card-action
        frigate_card_action: camera_select
        camera: camera.office
      - action: custom:frigate-card-action
        frigate_card_action: live
```
</details>

### Using a PTZ picture element

The card supports a custom PTZ element (`custom:frigate-card-ptz`) to conveniently control pan, tilt and zoom for cameras.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Using the native PTZ picture element</summary>

This example shows the native PTZ element when the `live` or `image` view is displayed and the stream (media) has loaded.

```yaml
[...]
elements:
  - type: custom:frigate-card-conditional
    conditions:
      media_loaded: true
      view:
        - live
        - image
    elements:
      - type: custom:frigate-card-ptz
        orientation: horizontal
        style:
          transform: none
          right: 20px
          top: 180px
        service: sonoff.send_command
        data_left:
          device: '048123'
          cmd: left
        data_right:
          device: '048123'
          cmd: right
        data_up:
          device: '048123'
          cmd: up
        data_down:
          device: '048123'
          cmd: down
```
</details>

<a name="card-updates"></a>

### Using `card-mod` to style the card

This card allows the use of
[card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) to style arbitrary
card contents. `card-mod` can be complex to use and relies on the underlying
internal DOM structure to style elements -- as such, while its use is possible
it's not officially supported and no attempt is made to preserve backwards
compatability of the internal DOM between any versions. It'll look good, but you're on your own!

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Use card-mod to style a Picture elements label</summary>

This example changes the color and removes the padding around a [Picture
Elements state
label](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/#state-label).

```yaml
[...]
card_mod:
  style:
    frigate-card-elements $:
      hui-state-label-element $: |
        div {
          padding: 0px !important;
          color: blue;
        }
```
</details>

### Overriding default menu behavior

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Overriding default menu behavior</summary>

This example moves the fullscreen button into its own group aligned to the `left`, enables the `image` button and orders it furthest to the `right`.

```yaml
[...]
menu:
  alignment: right
  buttons:
    image:
      enabled: true
      priority: 100
    fullscreen:
      alignment: opposing
```
</details>

### Using a dependent camera

`dependencies.cameras` allows events/recordings for other cameras to be shown along with the currently selected camera. For example, this can be used to show events with the `birdseye` camera (since it will not have events of its own).

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Using dependent cameras with birdseye</summary>

This example shows events for two other cameras when `birdseye` is selected.

```yaml
[...]
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.kitchen
  - camera_entity: camera.sitting_room
  - camera_name: birdseye
    dependencies:
      cameras:
        - camera.kitchen
        - camera.sitting_room
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Using all dependent cameras with birdseye</summary>

This example shows events for all other cameras when `birdseye` is selected. This is just a shortcut for naming all other cameras.

```yaml
[...]
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.kitchen
  - camera_entity: camera.sitting_room
  - frigate:
      camera_name: birdseye
    dependencies:
      all_cameras: true
```
</details>

### Using Scan Mode

Have your card follow the action with Scan Mode.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Using scan mode</summary>

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.back_yard
    # This camera will automatically trigger by occupancy.
  - camera_entity: camera.front_door
    triggers:
      occupancy: false
      motion: true
      entities:

view:
  scan:
    enabled: true
    trigger_show_border: true
```
</details>

### Changing the Media Layout

Change how the media fits and is positioned within the card dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Stretching an image</summary>

Stretch the stock Frigate card image into a 4:4 square.

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.landing
view:
  default: image
dimensions:
  aspect_ratio_mode: static
  aspect_ratio: '4:4'

```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Convert a landscape camera to a portrait live view</summary>

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.landing
dimensions:
  aspect_ratio_mode: static
  aspect_ratio: '9:16'
live:
  layout:

    position:
      x: 0
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand: Complex example to vary the media layouts for different cameras</summary>

Configure three cameras (all natively landscape): the first uses automatic expansion of dimensions (the default), the second uses a portrait (`9:16`) card focused on the left side (`x` == `0`) of the media, the third uses a portrait (`9:16`) card focused on the right side (`x` == `100`) of the media.

## Card Refreshes

Four sets of flags govern when the card will automatically refresh in the
absence of user interaction.

The following table describes the behavior these flags have.

### Card Update Truth Table

Note that no (other) automated updates are permitted when [scan mode](#scan-mode) is being triggered.

In the below "Trigger Entities" refers to the combination of `view.update_entities` and the `triggers.entities` for the currently selected camera (which in turn will also include the occupancy and motion sensor entities for Frigate cameras if `triggers.occupancy` and `triggers.motion` options are enabled, see [Trigger Configuration](#camera-triggers-configuration)).

| `view . update_seconds` | `view . timeout_seconds` | `view . update_force` | Trigger Entities | Behavior |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | - |
| `0` | `0` | *(Any value)* | Unset | Card will not automatically refresh. |

### Usecases For Automated Refreshes

 * Refreshing the `live` thumbnails every 30 seconds.
```yaml
view:
  default: live
  update_seconds: 30
```
 * Using `clip` or `snapshot` as the default view (for the most recent clip or
   snapshot respectively) and having the card automatically refresh (to fetch a
   newer clip/snapshot) on motion.
```yaml
cameras:
  - entity: camera.office
    triggers:
      motion: true
```
 * Cycle the live view of the camera every 60 seconds
```yaml
view:
  update_cycle_camera: true
  update_seconds: 60
```
 * Return to the most recent clip of the default camera 30 seconds after user
   interaction with the card stops.
```yaml
view:
  default: clip
  timeout_seconds: 30
```

### Casting the Card

This card can be (Chrome) casted to a device (such as a [Nest Hub](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen)) through the use of [Home Assistant Cast](https://cast.home-assistant.io/).

#### Instructions to Cast

* Visit [Home Assistant Cast](https://cast.home-assistant.io/) and click `Start Casting`
* Enter your Home Assistant URL, and authorize your account.
* Click `Start Casting` and choose the device to cast to from the browser menu.
* Choose which view/dashboard to display.
* If successful, the view will be cast to the device.

#### Limitations

Casting Home Assistant dashboards comes with a number of caveats:

* Home Assistant Casting does not support the HA `streaming` component ([source](https://cast.home-assistant.io/faq.html)). This means clips playing and the `ha` live provider can not work. Other live providers such as `jsmpeg` and `webrtc-card` function correctly.
* The Javascript fullscreen API does not work (so the fullscreen button does not work, but see below for an equivalent).

#### Recommended configuration for a Nest Hub

Using a `panel` dashboard with the following base configuration will result in the card consuming the entire device screen:

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-card
cameras:
  - camera_entity: camera.front_door
    live_provider: jsmpeg
dimensions:
  aspect_ratio: 1024:600
  aspect_ratio_mode: static
```

See [screenshot above](#screenshots-card-casting).

## Troubleshooting

<a name="v4-troubleshooting"></a>

### v4 doesn't show recordings / clips

You must be using a version of the [Frigate integration](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration) >= 3.0.0-rc.2 to see recordings. Using an older version of the integration may also show blank thumbnails in the events viewer. Please upgrade your integration accordingly.

### `Forbidden media source identifier`

* If you are using a custom `client_id` setting in your `frigate.yml` file (the configuration file for the Frigate backend itself), you must tell the card about it. See [camera configuration](#camera-frigate-configuration").
* You must have the `Enable the media browser` option enabled for the Frigate integration, in order for media fetches to work for the card. Media fetches are used to fetch events / clips / snapshots, etc. If you just wish to use live streams without media fetches, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
live:
  controls:
    thumbnails:
      mode: none
```

### Static image URL with credentials doesn't load

Your browser will not allow a page/script (like this card) to pass credentials to a cross-origin (different host) image URL for security reasons. There is no way around this unless you could also control the webserver that is serving the image to specifically allow `crossorigin` requests (which is typically not the case for an image served from a camera, for example). The stock Home Assistant Picture Glance card has the same limitation, for the same reasons.

### Chrome autoplays when a tab becomes visible again

Even if `live.auto_play` or `media_viewer.auto_play` is set to `never`, Chrome itself will still auto play a video that was previously playing prior to the tab being hidden, once that tab is visible again. This behavior cannot be influenced by the card. Other browsers (e.g. Firefox, Safari) do not exhibit this behavior.

### The `live` view just shows a blank white image during loading

For some slowly loading cameras, for which [Home Assistant stream preloading](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera/) is not enabled, Home Assistant may return a blank white image when asked for a still. These stills are used during initial Frigate card load of the `live` view if the `live.show_image_during_load` option is enabled. Disabling this option should show the default media loading controls (e.g. a spinner or empty video player) instead of the blank white image.

<a name="jsmpeg-troubleshooting"></a>

### Timeline shows error message

If the timeline shows a message such as `Failed to receive response from Home
Assistant for request.` make sure you are running a version of the [Frigate
integration](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration) >=
3.0.0-rc.1.

### Fullscreen Button Does Not Appear On iPhone

Unfortunately, [iOS does not support the Javascript fullscreen
API](https://caniuse.com/fullscreen). As a result, card-level fullscreen support
for the iPhone is not currently possible.

### Android Will Not Render >4 JSMPEG Live Views

Android Webview (as used by Android Chrome / Android Home Assistant Companion)
appears to severely limit the number of simultaneous OpenGL contexts that can be
opened. The JSMPEG player (that this card uses), consumes 1 OpenGL context per
rendering.

This limitation may be worked around (at a performance penalty) by disabling
OpenGL for JSMPEG live views:

```yaml
live:
  jsmpeg:
    options:
      disableGl: true
```

[This bug](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/191) has some
more discussion on this topic. New ideas to address this underlying limitation
most welcome!

### Carousels with video players cannot be dragged in Firefox

The Firefox video player swallows mouse interactions, so dragging is not
possible in carousels that use the Firefox video player (e.g. `clips` carousel,
or live views that use the `frigate` or `webrtc-card` provider). The next and
previous buttons may be used to navigate in these instances.

Dragging works as expected for snapshots, or for the `jsmpeg` provider.

### Progress bar cannot be dragged in Safari

Dragging the Safari video controls "progress bar" conflicts with carousel "dragging", meaning the video controls progress bar cannot be moved left or right. Turning off carousel dragging (and using next/previous controls) will return full video controls in Safari:

```yaml
live:
  draggable: false
media_viewer:
  draggable: false
```

### `webrtc_card` unloads in the background

[AlexxIT's WebRTC Card](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC) which is embedded by the `webrtc_card` live provider internally disconnects the stream when the browser tab is changed (regardless of any Frigate card configuration settings, e.g. `lazy_unload`). To allow the stream to continue running in the background, pass the `background` argument to the `webrtc_card` live provider as shown below. This effectively allows the Frigate card to decide whether or not to unload the stream.

```yaml
live:
  webrtc_card:
    background: true
```

### `double_tap` does not work for [card-wide actions](#actions) on Android

The Android video player swallows `double_tap` interactions in order to
rewind or fast-forward. Workarounds:

* Use `hold` instead of `double_tap` for your card-wide action.
* Use a [Frigate Card Element](#frigate-card-elements) or menu icon to trigger
  the action instead.

### Home Assistant iOS App not updating after card version change

Try resetting the app frontend cache:

* `Configuration -> Companion App -> Debugging -> Reset frontend cache`

### Casting to a remote media player does not work

This could be for any number of reasons. Chromecast devices can be quite picky on network, DNS and certificate issues, as well as audio and video codecs. Check your Home Assistant log as there may be more information in there.

**NOTE**: In particular, for Frigate to support casting of clips, the default ffmpeg settings for Frigate must be modified, i.e. Frigate does not encode clips in a Chromecast compatible format out of the box (specifically: audio must be enabled in the AAC codec, whether your camera supports audio or not). See the [Frigate Home Assistant documentation](https://docs.frigate.video/integrations/home-assistant) or [this issue](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/issues/3175) for more.

### Javascript console shows `[Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking [...] event`

This card heavily uses [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) -- a light-weight performant carousel library -- to show media. This carousel library uses non-passive event-listeners in a considered and performant way, but one that still causes occasional and unhelpful Chrome warnings. These warnings can be safely ignored in this instance, and cannot easily be fixed in the underlying library as it heavily relies on non-passive event listeners ([see this bug comment for explanation](https://github.com/davidjerleke/embla-carousel/issues/62#issuecomment-628569509)).

## Development

### Building

This project uses [Volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to ensure a consistent version of Node and Yarn are used during development. If you install Volta in your environment, you should not need to worry about which version of both to choose. **Note:** the dev container already comes with Volta installed.

However, if you are not using Volta, you can check the `volta` key in the [`package.json`](./package.json) for a reference on which version of Node and Yarn should be used.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card
$ cd frigate-hass-card
$ yarn install
$ yarn run build
```

Resultant build will be at `dist/frigate-hass-card.js`. This could be installed via the [manual installation instructions above](#manual-installation).

### Dev Container

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card)

You can use the [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension to speed up the development environment creation. Simply:

1. Clone the repository to your machine
1. Open VS Code on it
1. Reopen the folder in the Dev Container
1. Once done, press `F5` to start debugging

Everything should just work without any additional configuration. Under the hood, the dev container setup takes care of bringing up:

* Home Assistant (port `8123` or the next available one)
* Frigate (ports `5000` or the next available one)
* MQTT (port `1883` or the next available one)

As docker-compose containers.

* The Frigate Home Assistant Integration is registered as a `git submodule` at `.devcontainer/frigate-hass-integration`, and VS Code will initialize/clone it for you before opening the dev container.

Some environment variables are supported in a `.env` file:

* `FRIGATE_VERSION`: The version of Frigate to use. Defaults to the latest stable version.
* `HA_VERSION`: The version of Home Assistant to use. Defaults to the latest stable version.

> **NOTE**: When not specifying any version, it's recommended that you `docker-compose pull` the stack from time to time to ensure you have the latest versions of the images.

The Home Assistant container will get preconfigured during first initialization, therefore, if you changed the Home Assistant configuration, you will need to remove the HA container and start another.

### Releasing

1. Merge a PR that contains only a `package.json` and `const.ts` version number bump (see [this example](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/commit/a854187d4a354f8841ad284d75b0afbed7b634c4)).
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/releases).
1. A release draft will automatically have been created, click 'Edit'.
1. Use the same version number for the release title and tag.
1. Choose 'This is a pre-release' for a beta version.
1. Hit 'Publish release'.
